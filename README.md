# Analytical-Data-Platform-eEcommerce-AWS
In this project, I simulate lof of user purchases, product views, cart history and the user journeys on an online platform in Batch and Realtime.
The batch processing involves data ingestion, Data Lake, Aws Kinesis, Glue and Quicksignt.
The real-time layer involves detecting DDos and Bot attachs using Flink, AWS Lambda, DyanmoDB, CloudWatch and AWS SNS.
